# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Pewlett-Hackard is a company that has over 300,000 employees.  Many of these employees are approaching retirement age within the next three years. These retirements will lead to a significant number of job openings. Pewlett-Hackard has asked for an analysis of whether or not they will have enough remaining employees to be mentored by the upcoming retirees through a mentorship program they offer.  They also need to know the number of job vacancies to begin looking for applicants to fill these positions. 


### Results: 

In order to determine the number of employees retiring, the employee data was filtered based on the employee date of birth.  We assumed that those born between 1/1/1952 and 1/1/1955 will be retiring soon.  Using this criteria, we found the following information to base our results on.

Engineering will take the greatest hit for numbers of retirees. In total, 45,397 engineering positions will become available. This will require some extensive work for Pewlett-Hackard to replace this many positions. Additional exploration will need to be done to offer an attractive employment package for future candidates. 
* 29,414 Senior Engineers will be retiring.  
* 14,222 Engineers and
* 1,761 Assistant Engineers

Additionally, there are:
* 28,254 Senior Staff retiring
* 12,243 Staff members retiring
* 4,502 Technique Leaders retiring and
* 2 Management staff retiring
 

### Summary: 

* Pewlett-Hackard has 300,024 current employees.  90,398 of these employees will be of retirement age in the next three years, resulting in just over 90,000 job vacancies. This is a large amount of vacancies that will need to be filled in the upcoming years.  

* Pewlett-Hackard has a mentorship program that consists of future retirees to mentor the remaining employees.  Those employees included in the program held the same current title as the retiree and had a date of birth from 1/1/1965 - 12/31/1965.  According to the analysis, there would be a very small number (1,549) employees eligible for the program.  This results in a very large ratio of retiree to mentor and in one case, no current employee to mentor.   



* By expanding the mentorship program to include the birthdates of current employees to 1/1/1964 - 12/31/1965, this greatly expands those eligible for mentorship and allows for a much more realistic ratio of retirees to mentored employee.
