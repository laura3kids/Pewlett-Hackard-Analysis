# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 
Pewlett-Hackard is a company that has over 300,000 employees.  Many of these employees are approaching retirement age within the next three years. These retirements will lead to a significant number of job openings. Pewlett-Hackard has asked for an analysis of whether or not they will have enough remaining employees to be mentored by the upcoming retirees through a mentorship program they offer.  They also need to know the number of job vacancies to begin looking for applicants to fill these positions.
